*The theme btn is now fully functional and the users selected theme persists/is stored in local storage.*<br>
- Completed the calendar and its functionality for now. View it [here](https://asp-projects-team-38.github.io/Meal-App-View-Frontend/planner.html).<br>
*The calendar btns are functional and display an add meal popup.*<br><br>
- *\*I need to add comments to the PopulateCalendar class I created, to explain what each function does. I'll also be creating a summary doc on the calendar/planner to make it easier to integrate with the backend. Plus a summary doc for the functions I created in SASS for the CSS. (Worthy)\**
